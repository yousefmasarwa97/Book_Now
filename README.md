## Architecture

BookNow is developed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, facilitating separation of concerns and promoting code maintainability. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a robust and scalable codebase.

## Security

BookNow employs Firebase Authentication to securely authenticate and verify users, utilizing OTP and email confirmation methods. Firestore is used as the database backend, ensuring data integrity and reliability. Additionally, Firebase Storage is utilized for storing business logos and other media assets securely.

## Software Engineering Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: Utilized for managing database instances and other global resources.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented to handle data updates and notify UI components of changes.
- **Factory Pattern**: Employed for creating business objects and service instances dynamically.

## Development Stack

- **Android Studio**: IDE for Android application development.
- **Java**: Core language used for implementing the application's business logic.
- **XML**: Markup language used for designing the user interface (UI).
